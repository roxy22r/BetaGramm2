## Lessons-Learned
- Racism Bad
- MEGELTOME EH 
### What is Vue?
Vue is a client sided Java-Script Webframework for the creation of Single-Page-Webapplications for the MVVM-Pattern.
It can be used for some Multipage-Websites though.
Version 2.0 Supports Serversided rendering.
### Bootstrap-Vue
We have learned that with Vue 3 or generally with
it was very difficult to use the node package bootstraap-vue.
Because no matter how much changing and rearranging we did, it didn't work.
In the end we did most of the design ourselves.
Up to the point that we realised very late, that we could also install the normal bootstrap without this special variant.
Well we should've done tinyer steps
### Creating a form
We stuggled to send the form data to the logic part from Vue.
The solution was quite simple and easy in retrospect, but the problem was that it was very unusual for us that the logic was also in the same file. Conclusion don't be afraid of new things even if they are not your personal preference.

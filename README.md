Bootstrap-Vue
We have learned that with Vue 3 or generally with
it was very difficult to use the node package bootstraap-vue.
Because no matter how much changing and rearranging we did, it didn't work.
In the end we did most of the design ourselves.
Up to the point that we realised very late, that we could also install the normal bootstrap without this special variant.
Well we should've done tinyer steps
